# Dynamic Electric Pricing Prediction

![Dynamic Electric Pricing Prediction](image.png)  <!-- Replace with the actual path to your image -->

This project, hosted at [Electricity Management](https://electricity-management.vercel.app/), is a dynamic electricity pricing prediction platform. It leverages machine learning to forecast electricity prices, allowing users to optimize their energy consumption based on real-time data.

## Overview

The platform predicts electricity prices based on factors like time of day, demand, and historical pricing patterns. By providing real-time predictions, it assists users in minimizing energy costs by adjusting their usage according to lower tariff periods.

## Features

- **Dynamic Pricing Predictions**: Machine learning models analyze and forecast pricing fluctuations.
- **Time-of-Use Optimization**: Recommendations for shifting energy consumption to cost-effective periods.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive design to make pricing predictions easily accessible.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Clone this repository and install dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/electricity-management.git
cd electricity-management
npm install

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
